SymtoSense is an innovative web application developed as a part of a college project to provide
users with a convenient and accessible tool for identifying potential medical conditions based
on their symptoms. The application combines user authentication, symptom analysis, and
information retrieval to offer a comprehensive health assessment platform. Developed using
Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL, and utilizing XAMPP for the development environment,
SymtoSense demonstrates the practical application of web technologies in solving real-world
problems. The backend functionality of SymtoSense is implemented through servlets
(AuthController and SymptomSearchServlet), while the database connectivity is managed by
a dedicated utility class (DBConnection). The application follows the Model-View-Controller
(MVC) architecture, promoting a clear separation between business logic and
presentation.SymtoSense serves as a practical example of how web applications can be
leveraged to provide health-related information and services. It showcases essential web
development skills, including user authentication, session management, and database
interaction, making it an excellent project for demonstrating proficiency in web technologies.
